You will find in the sub directories P_5kPa, P_50kPa, P_90kPa, P_50kPa_prep_fric and Size all the data obtained with LAMMPS during my PhD. Only the extracted have been stored. If you want to extract files from LAMMPS use the treatement and the associated python routines. 

To reconstruct the graph use the stack, stack_relax or rheo python routines with the associated files (_files and _graph).
