You will find here the LAMMPS code, the python routine and the datas obtained for during my PhD. 

The data files have been lighten in order to be stored in github, you will only have to use the stack, stack_file, stack_graph, stack_relax, stack_relax_file, stack_relax_graph, rheo, rheo_file and rheo_graph routine to reproduce my datas. 

  -> if you want the raw datas please send me a message I will a way to send you the entire data set if you need/want to redo the extraction your self. 
  
All the data extracted are stored in run_*/extr_data. 

  -> in run_*/extr_data/data/ are stored the data obtained during the preparation and the simple shear test of the granular assembly. 
  
  -> in run_*/extr_data/data_ela/data_ela_*/ are stored the data of the small strain oscillatory test AND the relaxation test at the different level of deformation. 


Please check your path in stack, stack_relax and rheo before using the python routine.
